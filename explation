Explanation:

The first error occurs on the first line, it should be "email" instead of "emai".

In the second line, we need to split the "domain" variable instead of the "domin" variable.

In the return state, we need to start the reduce function, the initial value is 0, because it is a summation operation.

After applying these fixes, the function returns the correct answer.
